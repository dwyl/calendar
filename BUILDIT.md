# Build it üë©‚Äçüíª 

This is a log 
of the steps taken 
to build this SPIKE.

</div>

We assume you have foundational knowledge
with Elixir and Phoenix.
If you don't, 
we suggest you visit 
[`learn-phoenix-framework`](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-phoenix-framework)
to learn more about Phoenix and Elixir.

Therefore, 
we are going to assume you have some experience
working with `Phoenix`,
and thus gloss over some implementation details.

This tutorial works with `Phoenix 1.7` 
and Elixir `1.14`.
Make sure you have these installed
so you can follow this tutorial more precisely.

- [1. Adding `Google Auth` and basic flow in our app](#1-adding-google-auth-and-basic-flow-in-our-app)


# 0. Creating sample `Phoenix` project

Let's create our sample project.
In your terminal, type:

```sh
mix phx.new cal --no-mailer --no-dashboard
```

This will create a sample `Phoenix` project
without e-mail services and dashboard.

After creating this tutorial,
please visit the 
`13. What is not tested` section in
https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example#13-what-is-not-tested
to add `coveralls` to our application.
This will make it easier to test our application
and see the coverage of our codebase.

After doing the changes,
your `mix.exs` file should look like so.

[`mix.exs`](https://github.com/dwyl/calendar/blob/88bc9960b1513bba6963708e03d059445dfce684/mix.exs)

> **Note**
>
> Make sure you have the `aliases` similar to our files.
> With this, we can run commands like `mix c` 
> that will make it much easier to see the test coverage,
> for example.

After making these changes,
if you run `mix s`,
you'll have the app running on `localhost:4000`
and it should look like so.

Awesome! üéâ

We're ready to go.


# 1. Adding `Google Auth` and basic flow in our app

Now let's go over adding a way for the user
to authenticate with `Google` in our app.

Luckily, we've developed a package
that will allow you to easily integrate Google authentication
onto the application - 
[`dwyl/elixir-auth-google`](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-google).

Follow the instructions 
and you should be able to have Google authentication working on the application.

Here are the changes you should have:

- created `GoogleAuthController` inside `lib/cal_web/controllers`.
The 
[`lib/cal_web/router.ex`](https://github.com/dwyl/calendar/blob/baae5b735c05b29c937ad132c43ce0129638a44b/lib/cal_web/router.ex#L21-L23)
file should look like so.

```elixir
  scope "/", CalWeb do
    pipe_through :browser

    get "/", PageController, :home
    get "/app", AppController, :app

    get "/auth/google/callback", GoogleAuthController, :index
  end
```

Your `GoogleAuthController`
inside [`lib/cal_web/controllers/google_auth_controller.ex` ](https://github.com/dwyl/calendar/blob/baae5b735c05b29c937ad132c43ce0129638a44b/lib/cal_web/controllers/google_auth_controller.ex)
should look like so:

```elixir
defmodule CalWeb.GoogleAuthController do
  use CalWeb, :controller

  @doc """
  `index/2` handles the callback from Google Auth API redirect.
  """
  def index(conn, %{"code" => code}) do
    {:ok, token} = ElixirAuthGoogle.get_token(code, conn)

    conn
    |> put_flash(:token, token)
    |> redirect(to: ~p"/app")
  end
end
```

We are using the package to get the token needed
to communicate with the Google APIs 
that control the person information.
We use `put_flash/2` to add this token 
to later be used in the `/app` URL.

- created 
[`app_controller.ex`](https://github.com/dwyl/calendar/blob/baae5b735c05b29c937ad132c43ce0129638a44b/lib/cal_web/controllers/app_controller.ex)
and [`app_html.ex`](https://github.com/dwyl/calendar/blob/baae5b735c05b29c937ad132c43ce0129638a44b/lib/cal_web/controllers/app_html.ex) 
inside `lib/cal_web/controllers`
and 
[`app.html.heex`](https://github.com/dwyl/calendar/blob/baae5b735c05b29c937ad132c43ce0129638a44b/lib/cal_web/controllers/app_html/app.html.heex) 
inside `lib/cal_web/controllers/app_html`
(`AppController` pertains to the application 
the user will login into.
It's located inside the `/app` URL).
These files pertain to the view and controllers
of the **app** (located in `/app` URL) 
where the user will see the calendar events.

Your `app_html.ex` file should look like:

```elixir
defmodule CalWeb.AppHTML do
  use CalWeb, :html

  embed_templates "app_html/*"
end
```

Your `app_controller.ex` should look like so.
Take note we use `get_flash/2` 
to use the `token` object
we've fetched earlier on the callback
during the login process.

```elixir
defmodule CalWeb.AppController do
  use CalWeb, :controller

  def app(conn, _params) do

    conn = case get_flash(conn, :token) do
      nil -> conn
      token -> assign(conn, :token, token)
    end

    render(conn, :app, layout: false)
  end
end
```

Your `app.html.heex` file will be empty.
Just a simple `<div>` with text 
to check if the flow of the app is correctly setup.

```html
<div>
    app
</div>
```

- added the login button 
inside [`lib/cal_web/controllers/page_html/home.html.heex`](https://github.com/dwyl/calendar/blob/baae5b735c05b29c937ad132c43ce0129638a44b/lib/cal_web/controllers/page_html/home.html.heex#L61-L64).

```html

</a>
```

- changed `lib/cal_web/controllers/page_controller.ex`
to pass the token URL that is used in the HTML page.

```elixir
defmodule CalWeb.PageController do
  use CalWeb, :controller

  def home(conn, _params) do
    # The home page is often custom made,
    # so skip the default app layout.
    oauth_google_url = ElixirAuthGoogle.generate_oauth_url(conn)
    render(conn, :home, [layout: false, oauth_google_url: oauth_google_url])
  end
end
```
